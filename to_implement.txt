1. SSAO from learnopengl - done
2. shadow mapping with randomized poisson sampling, cascaded shadow mapping (CSM)
3. trees similar to dynamic trees mod
4. water mesh for each chunk either with depth effect and flow map based on vertex information
5. HDR with bloom, imissive maps
6. precipitation, heat, and height map for generating biomes
7. compute shader terrain generation
8. camera frustum culling
9. day and night cycle with sky cubemap
10. clouds
11. weather cycle with rain, thunderstorms, sandstorms, and snow. rain could influence SSR
12. screen space reflections
13. use stencil buffer to not calculate sky and reflections for non-specular surfaces
14. player AABB collision and controls with following camera
15. mesh regeneration
16. block breaking and placing
17. multithreaded greedy meshing algorithm (does it matter? cost for rendering is lower with deferred shading, but could help if render distance is high)
18. chunk LODs, chunks that render in further use less polys, but when the player gets closer it remeshes
19. SMAA anti-aliasing
20. player animation - walking, running, crouching, jumping, falling, swimming, diving, rowing, climbing, bow animations, sword animations, long sword animation, axe animation, pickaxe animation, drinking, eating
